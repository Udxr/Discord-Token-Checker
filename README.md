# Discord-Token-Checker
A easy and safe program to check tokens to see if they are invalid, valid or unverified.

## Installation

Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)<br />
Run `install_packages.bat` (This will install all the necessary packages for the program to work)

```js
node checker.js
```

Feel free to use the code for anything you want. I am happy with no credit.
